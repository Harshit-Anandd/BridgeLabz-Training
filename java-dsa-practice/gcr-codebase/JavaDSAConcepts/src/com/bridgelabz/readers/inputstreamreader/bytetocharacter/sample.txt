### ✅ Overview
- Learned fundamental **sorting algorithms** and their role in organizing data efficiently
- Understood how different sorting techniques vary in approach, performance, and use cases
- Analyzed time and space complexity to choose suitable algorithms
- Applied sorting logic to solve real-world data ordering problems

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Sorting fundamentals and importance
- Comparison-based sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Non-comparison-based sorting:
  - Counting Sort
  - Overview of Radix Sort and Bucket Sort
- Divide and Conquer approach in sorting
- Stability, in-place sorting, and complexity analysis (best, average, worst cases)

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented multiple sorting algorithms on arrays of primitive data
- Solved practical problems such as sorting:
  - Student marks and exam scores
  - Employee IDs
  - Book prices and product prices
  - Salary expectations and age data
- Compared algorithm performance based on input size and data distribution
- Completed sorting algorithm submissions and pushed implementations to the repository

### 🧩 Scenario-Based Problems (OOP Practice)
- Solved **object-oriented scenario-based problems** unrelated to sorting logic
- Designed real-world systems such as:
  - College management and course enrollment platforms
  - Online shopping and cart management systems
- Identified classes, attributes, methods, and relationships from scenarios
- Applied OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation for data protection
  - Inheritance for shared structure
  - Interfaces for defining contracts
  - Polymorphism for flexible behavior
- Strengthened ability to translate problem statements into clean OOP designs
