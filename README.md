**(Date: 16-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the fundamentals of **Java programming** and its evolution
- Understood Java’s core features, platform independence, and execution flow
- Explored basic program structure, syntax, and coding standards
- Built a strong foundation for writing clean and readable Java programs

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- History and evolution of Java
- Key features of Java and object-oriented nature
- Understanding **JDK, JRE, and JVM** and Java execution workflow
- Structure of a Java program and `main` method
- Data types:
  - Primitive and non-primitive data types
- Java operators:
  - Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, unary, bitwise, ternary
  - `instanceof` operator
- `static` keyword:
  - Static variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes
  - Static vs non-static context and memory behavior
- Java access modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Java naming conventions for packages, classes, methods, variables, and constants

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Wrote basic Java programs including HelloWorld and input-output examples
- Set up GitHub repository.
