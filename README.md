## 📌 Day 15 – Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, Linked List  
**(Date: 2-Jan-2026)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the fundamentals of **Data Structures** with a focus on **Linked Lists**
- Understood how linked lists enable dynamic memory management
- Explored different types of linked lists and their real-world applications
- Applied linked list concepts to build efficient and flexible data-handling solutions

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Data Structures overview and importance
- Linked List fundamentals and node structure
- Types of Linked Lists:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- Core operations:
  - Insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching
- Advantages, limitations, and use cases of each linked list type
- Best practices for pointer handling and edge-case management

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented Singly Linked Lists for record management systems
- Built Doubly Linked Lists for bidirectional navigation scenarios
- Designed Circular Linked Lists for cyclic operations such as scheduling and playlists
- Practiced operations like add, delete, update, search, and display
- Applied clean and modular coding practices
