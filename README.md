## 📌 Day 15 – Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, Linked List  
**(Date: 2-Jan-2026)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the fundamentals of **Data Structures** with a focus on **Linked Lists**
- Understood how linked lists enable dynamic memory management
- Explored different types of linked lists and their real-world applications
- Applied linked list concepts to build efficient and flexible data-handling solutions

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Data Structures overview and importance
- Linked List fundamentals and node structure
- Types of Linked Lists:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- Core operations:
  - Insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching
- Advantages, limitations, and use cases of each linked list type
- Best practices for pointer handling and edge-case management

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented Singly Linked Lists for record management systems
- Built Doubly Linked Lists for bidirectional navigation scenarios
- Designed Circular Linked Lists for cyclic operations such as scheduling and playlists
- Practiced operations like add, delete, update, search, and display
- Applied clean and modular coding practices

## 📌 Day 16 – Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Function  
**(Date: 3-Jan-2026)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned core **Data Structures** concepts focusing on **Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, and Hashing Functions**
- Understood how these structures optimize data storage, retrieval, and processing
- Explored real-world use cases such as scheduling, buffering, caching, and lookups
- Applied best practices to design efficient and reliable data-handling solutions

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Stack:
  - LIFO principle and stack operations (push, pop, peek)
  - Applications such as expression evaluation and undo/redo
- Queue:
  - FIFO principle and queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek)
  - Types including Simple Queue, Priority Queue, and Deque
- HashMap:
  - Key-value storage and average O(1) performance
  - Internal working, collision handling, and resizing
- Hashing Function:
  - hashCode() and equals() contract
  - Collision handling and hashing best practices

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented stack-based solutions such as balanced parentheses checking
- Built queue-based systems like ticket counter and task scheduling
- Used HashMaps for frequency counting, lookups, and mappings
- Practiced overriding `hashCode()` and `equals()` for custom key classes
- Followed best practices for performance and correctness
- Completed submissions and pushed all implementations to the repository
