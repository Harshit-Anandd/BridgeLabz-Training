## 📌 Day 11 – this, static, final & instanceof
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the purpose and correct usage of the **this**, **static**, and **final** keywords in Java
- Understood how **static members** enable shared, class-level behavior
- Explored the **instanceof operator** for safe type-checking and runtime validation
- Gained clarity on when to use each keyword to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- `this` keyword for resolving ambiguity and constructor chaining
- `static` variables, methods, and their memory behavior
- `final` variables, methods, and classes for immutability and restriction
- `instanceof` operator for safe downcasting and polymorphic checks
- Best practices for combining `this`, `static`, `final`, and `instanceof`

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented multiple real-world Java programs using all four concepts together
- Used static members for shared data like counts, names, and configuration values
- Applied final variables for unique identifiers and constants
- Used instanceof checks to ensure safe object operations
- Committed and pushed all practice programs to the repository
