## 📌 Day 19 – Runtime Analysis of Algorithms & Big-O Notation
**(Date: 7-Jan-2026)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned how to evaluate **algorithm efficiency** using runtime analysis
- Understood **Big-O notation** to measure time and space complexity
- Analyzed algorithm performance across best, average, and worst cases
- Applied complexity analysis to make informed design and optimization decisions

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Runtime analysis and its importance in algorithm design
- Big-O notation and common complexity classes:
  - O(1), O(log N), O(N), O(N log N), O(N²), O(2ⁿ), O(N!)
- Time complexity analysis with practical examples
- Space complexity analysis and memory trade-offs
- Best, average, and worst case analysis
- Practical optimization guidelines for Java programs

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Analyzed time and space complexity of search and sorting algorithms
- Compared algorithm performance using empirical data
- Evaluated trade-offs between different approaches (iterative vs recursive)
- Applied Big-O analysis to real Java code samples

### 🧩 Scenario-Based Problems (OOP Practice)
- Designed real-world systems such as:
  - Loan approval automation platforms
  - Digital bookstore and order management systems
  - Smart parking management applications
- Identified classes, attributes, methods, and relationships from scenarios
- Applied OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation for data protection
  - Inheritance for shared structure
  - Interfaces for defining contracts
  - Polymorphism for flexible business logic
- Strengthened ability to translate real-world requirements into clean, maintainable OOP designs
