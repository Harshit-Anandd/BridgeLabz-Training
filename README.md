## 📅 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming

---

## 📌 Day 9 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Explored **procedural programming** and understood its limitations  
- Compared **procedural vs object-oriented programming** paradigms  
- Learned why **OOP** is widely used in modern software development  

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Class and Object  
- Encapsulation and Abstraction  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Added initial setup to the new branch
- Implemented sample programs using the object-oriented programming approach
- Solved the given problem set
- Committed and pushed the code to the repository

## 📌 Day 10 – Constructors, Class Members, & Access Modifiers
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the purpose and usage of **constructors** in Java for object initialization
- Explored **default, parameterized, and copy constructors**
- Understood the difference between **instance variables/methods** and **class (static) variables/methods**
- Gained clarity on **access modifiers** and their role in encapsulation and data security

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Constructor overloading and constructor chaining
- Use of the `this` keyword
- Instance vs static members
- Access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, default, and `private`
- Encapsulation and controlled data access

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented multiple Java programs demonstrating constructor usage
- Used static variables to manage shared data across objects
- Applied access modifiers to restrict and control data visibility
- Successfully committed and pushed all practice programs to the repository

## 📌 Day 11 – this, static, final & instanceof
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned the purpose and correct usage of the **this**, **static**, and **final** keywords in Java
- Understood how **static members** enable shared, class-level behavior
- Explored the **instanceof operator** for safe type-checking and runtime validation
- Gained clarity on when to use each keyword to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- `this` keyword for resolving ambiguity and constructor chaining
- `static` variables, methods, and their memory behavior
- `final` variables, methods, and classes for immutability and restriction
- `instanceof` operator for safe downcasting and polymorphic checks
- Best practices for combining `this`, `static`, `final`, and `instanceof`

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Implemented multiple real-world Java programs using all four concepts together
- Used static members for shared data like counts, names, and configuration values
- Applied final variables for unique identifiers and constants
- Used instanceof checks to ensure safe object operations
- Committed and pushed all practice programs to the repository

## 📌 Day 12 – Object Modelling and UML Diagrams
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

### ✅ Overview
- Learned how to model real-world problems using **classes and objects**
- Understood **object relationships** and how objects interact within a system
- Explored **object-oriented design principles** using UML
- Gained clarity on translating problem statements into structured designs

### 📘 Core Concepts Covered
- Class vs Object
- Object relationships:
  - Association
  - Aggregation
  - Composition
- Object communication through method calls
- UML diagrams:
  - Class Diagrams
  - Object Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Designed UML diagrams for multiple real-world systems
- Modeled scenarios such as School, Bank, Library, Grocery Store, Hospital, and University systems
- Created Class Diagrams to represent static structure
- Created Object Diagrams to capture runtime object states
- Created Sequence Diagrams to show interaction flow and message ordering
- Submitted all diagram-based assignments and pushed them to the repository
