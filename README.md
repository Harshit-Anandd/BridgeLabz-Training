  - Primitive and non-primitive data types
- Java operators:
  - Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, unary, bitwise, ternary
  - `instanceof` operator
- `static` keyword:
  - Static variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes
  - Static vs non-static context and memory behavior
- Java access modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Java naming conventions for packages, classes, methods, variables, and constants

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice
- Wrote basic Java programs including HelloWorld and input-output examples
- Set up GitHub repository.
